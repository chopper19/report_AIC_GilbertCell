\section{Conclusions}

All the project has been developed keeping in mind his didactic purpose. It was beautiful mean for experimenting integrated analog design along with the use of professional cad tools. We learned the importance of complex simulated device models in order to have functioning circuits in sub-micrometer technologies. It has been an opportunity to prove layout strategies dealing with MOSIS' integrated design rules.
Given that, this work brings within it different limitations, mainly due to the fact that our process of learning has come along with the developing of the process itself. We had to learn by numerous trial and errors to design a circuit of which we knew just the theoretical working principle, gathering pieces from different articles and textbooks. Our inexperience led us to get involved from the beginning into an RF design with an elder technology, not intended for this purpose. Nor the simulation models provided by AMI06 are enough accurate to take count of many parasitics which can not be neglected in high frequency switched circuits. Thus we can say, with a certain amount of confidence, that all results and circuit performances shown here, would be by far worse if implemented on a physical device.
Nonetheless, since the problems encountered and measurements done in this work would have been the same on a better-technology/better-functioning circuit, our choice was yet to carry this project till the end.

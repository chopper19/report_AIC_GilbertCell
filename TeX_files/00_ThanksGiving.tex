\textbf{DA SISTEMARE}
	There are many deadlocks and
	dependencies which have to be taken into consideration while designing the specifications
	for the transistors in order to satisfy the above design constraints. All the calculated
	values are changed based on the parametric analysis of transistors in Cadence Virtuoso.
